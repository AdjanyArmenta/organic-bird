# Organic bird
This is a UX project :)

### Challenge
Design a specialized mobile app for an organic bird-feed brand

### First Course: Foundations of UX
~~~
During the first course, there wasn't really any solid evidence to show. That's why I'm putting together this summary – to capture the key points and highlights from that time
~~~

A good user experience embodies several key characteristics, ensuring that the product not only functions effectively but also enhances user satisfaction and accessibility. These fundamental traits include:

**Usable**: The product is not only functional but also user-friendly, making it easy for individuals to navigate and interact with.
**Equitable**: Designed to cater to a diverse range of abilities, ensuring accessibility for users with varying needs.
**Enjoyable**: The design goes beyond mere functionality; it aims to delight users, creating a positive emotional response.
**Useful**: The product serves its purpose by effectively solving user problems, addressing their needs and concerns.


#### Product Development Cycle: A Holistic Approach
<image src="img/product-development.png" alt="Product development cycle">
The product development cycle is a dynamic process comprising the following stages:

**Brainstorm**: A preliminary phase involving foundational research to understand user needs before delving into the design process.
**Define**: Clearly articulate the project's goals, requirements, and constraints.
**Design**: Develop a comprehensive design, considering usability, aesthetics, and overall user experience.
**Test**: Rigorous testing to ensure the product aligns with user expectations and resolves potential issues.
**Launch**: The final phase involves the product's official release.

#### Distinguishing Universal and Inclusive Design Terms

**Universal Design**: Creating a product that caters to the widest range of abilities and situations, essentially adopting a "one size fits all" approach.
**Inclusive Design**: Making deliberate design choices that account for personal identifiers such as ability, race, and others, with a focus on solving problems for one while extending benefits to many.

#### User-Centered Design and Equity-Focused Design
**User-Centered Design**: An approach that prioritizes the needs and preferences of end-users throughout the entire design process.
**Equity-Focused Design**: Tailoring designs to cater to groups historically underrepresented or ignored during product development.

#### The User Experience Journey
The user experience represents the journey users undertake with a product or service, emphasizing the importance of creating a positive and seamless interaction.

#### Design Thinking Framework
<image src="img/design-thinking.png" alt="Design sprint phases">
A user-centered problem-solving approach that involves activities like research, prototyping, and testing to deeply understand user needs and incorporate them into the design.

#### Design Sprint: Streamlining the Design Process
<image src="img/design-sprint.png" alt="Design sprint phases">
A time-bound process with five phases, each focusing on different aspects of the design:

- Understand
- Ideate
- Decide
- Prototype
- Test

Benefits of Design Sprints:

- Prioritizing user perspectives.
- Valuing every participant's input.
- Identifying the best ideas efficiently.
- Focused time allocation.
- Mitigating risks effectively.
- Research and Avoiding Biases in Product Development
- Product design should be grounded in research and facts, steering clear of assumptions.

#### Different types of biases: (fav topic) <3

##### We aren´t the users!!

**Confirmation Bias**: Seeking or interpreting information that confirms existing beliefs.
~~~
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Ask open-ended question
- Actively listen
- Involve a diverse sample of users.
~~~
**False Consensus Bias**: Overestimating agreement with one's ideas.
~~~
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Identify assumptions
- Survey a large and diverse group.
~~~
**Recency Bias:** Giving more weight to recent information.

**Social Desirability Bias:** Answering based on perceived expectations.
~~~
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Encourage honesty
- Build trust
- Use techniques to minimize socially desirable responses.
~~~
**Primacy Bias:** Placing more emphasis on the first piece of information.
~~~
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Take detailed notes
- Ensure consistent interview methods.
~~~
**Implicit Bias:** Unconscious attitudes or stereotypes influencing decisions.
~~~
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Increase awareness
- Engage in diversity training.
~~~
**Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing based on past investments.
~~~
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Break down projects
- Regularly reassess progress.
~~~
It's essential for individuals involved in decision-making processes, research, and design to be aware of these biases and actively work to minimize their impact to ensure fair, accurate, and objective outcomes

#### UX Research

UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors,needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.

**Foundational research** is always done *before* you start designing

- What should we build?
- What are the user problems?
- How can we solve them?

**Design research** is done *while* you design.

- How should we build it?

**Post-launch research** is done *after* the design is complete and your product has launched.


- Did we succeed?


#### Methods
<image src="img/research.png" alt="Types of Research">
How to get a research done

**Primary research:** is research you conduct yourself.Information from direct interactions with users, like interviews, surveys, or usability studies, are considered primary research

**Secondary research**: is research that uses information someone else has put together. For example, using information from sources like books, articles, or journals is considered secondary research.
